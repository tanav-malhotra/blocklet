Description: ASCII art generator using Unicode block characters

 characters to create beautiful text art. Unlike traditional tools
 like figlet, Blocklet uses solid blocks and box-drawing characters
 for a more polished look.

 Features include drop shadows, proper typographic descenders,
 multi-line support, and automatic word wrapping. It works on any
 terminal that supports Unicode (UTF-8).
